        <h2>When we first moved too Minnesota I swam for the Minnetonka Swim Team and also played soccer for Plymouth which soon turned into Fusion when it combined with Wyzeta. I also played a little bit of Tennis on the side. Soon I started getting more serious into Tennins and also started Noridc Skiing and so I quit Swimming and Soccer because i did not enjoy them as much. Now I am very serious in Tennis and Nordic Skiing and have becaome pretty good.
